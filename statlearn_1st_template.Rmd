Research Title
----------
Human activity recognition using smartphone's motion sensors.

----------


Abstract
----------
The goal of our project is to recognize and classify various human activities based on human's motion recorded by a smartphone motion-sensor, e.g walking, walking up-stairs, walking down-stairs, laying, sitting, standing, playing football, playing basketball, sprinting, running.

----------


Main research aim \& framework
----------
*Describe the main goal(s) of your project, why you are interested in it, 
and how you came up with this idea. If there are also secondary goals, list them too.*

The goal of our project is to identify the main differences beetwen some of various activities perfomed by humans in their daily life;
so we wil have to extract the main features defining theese activities and build a model to classify them. The final goal could be to using the obtained models to understand how people spend their days, and evaluate the level of sedententary and in a more general way their activities. Another important goal of this project is that it can help making recommendations based on activity level of people 
to improve their health.


*Please cite any paper, webpage, video, other kind of support material that 
help in understading the feasibility and relevance of your work.
List all the references in the last Section of this document.*

Data source(s) 
----------

*Is it actually the case in your application or you can achieve the same goal easily with other tools? Explain.*
  The science Journal App is essential to our project , so we will will be using it to collect the data , as our project is mainly based 
  on motion sensors use . 
 
*Are you using all the sensors or just a few? On this issue, the more the better!*
   We are limiting the project to motion sensors , so the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. These two are enough for our project

*Of course you may want to collect also other data via questionnaire or other tools: list them all explaining why you need them.*
  We could eventually need some more spedific apps providing more features to use on with smartphones motion sensors. There is also the possibility to use the API provided by The science Journal App to build some dedicated app with specific functionalities needed for 
  the project.

----------

Data collection
----------
*Explain how you are plannig to actually collect the data.*
The data that we will use will be gathered by doing experiments . All the experiments of interest  will be conducted 
using our smartphone in fixed conditions (duration, smartphone position on the body, same subjects...); then we will eventually integrate our data with datasets from the research made by UCI: "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set"

*How many data-points do you (realistically) hope to collect?*
The objective is to have at least 50 data points for every field of interest.

*Do you foresee any difficulty in the data collection process?*
The main diffult might be the conduction of the experiments in the same fixed conditions.

*Approximatively, how "heavy" do you think your dataset will be in the end?*
The dataset will be aproximally around 500 units.

----------

Model \& Methods
----------
*To the best of your current knowledge, what type of statistical/data analysis tools do you feel will be relevant?*


The most relevant one might be  clustering, classification methods or even Machine learning.

*Explain briefly why.*

   Our main objective is first of all to identify various motion and recognize them , based on their features . So these




*If there's some cutting edge methods you may like to implement, cite it here adding the relevant paper(s)/book(s) in the last Section of this document.*

- * deep learning

----------


Software/Hardware Toolkit
----------
*Tell me something about the software, programming language(s), package(s), module(s), framework(s) you're planning to use and why.*
  The main software we will be using are RStudio for all the part relate to R programming. Some part of the project might also be done 
  in Python using Anaconda distribution to provide both R and python package needed.
  
*Are you also planning to use or develop [dedicated hardware](https://sciencejournal.withgoogle.com/developers/) for this task?*
   The main hardware used is our smartphone to record experiments. So we wont need to build some dedicatd harware. 
   
   
*If you feel your home-computer/laptop may not be enough to handle everything, explain to me why and what kind of resources you may instead need.*
-- NO

----------

Project Timeline
----------
*Assuming I like and approve your proposal, detail how you are planning to organize your work in terms of sub-tasks completion.
