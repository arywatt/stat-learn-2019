Research Title
----------
*Human activity detection using smartphone's motion sensors.*

----------


Abstract
----------
*The goal of our project is to recognize and classify various human activities based on human's motion recorded by a smartphone motion-sensor, e.g walking, walking up-stairs, walking down-stairs, laying, sitting, standing, playing football, playing basketball, sprinting, running.*

----------


Main research aim \& framework
----------
*Describe the main goal(s) of your project, why you are interested in it, 
and how you came up with this idea. If there are also secondary goals, list them too.*

The goal of our project is to identify the main differences beetwen some of various activities perfomed by humans in their daily life;
so we wil have to extract the main features defining theese activities and build a model to classify them. The final goal could be to using the obtained models to understand how people spend their days, and evaluate and recognize their activities


*Please cite any paper, webpage, video, other kind of support material that 
help in understading the feasibility and relevance of your work.
List all the references in the last Section of this document.*

----------


Data source(s) 
----------
*As you know, the [Science Journal App](https://sciencejournal.withgoogle.com/experiments/) **must** be central to the achievement of your goal: this is essentially the only real constraint you have to deal with.*
*Is it actually the case in your application or you can achieve the same goal easily with other tools? Explain.*
*Are you using all the sensors or just a few? On this issue, the more the better!*
*Of course you may want to collect also other data via questionnaire or other tools: list them all explaining why you need them.*

----------

Data collection
----------
*Explain how you are plannig to actually collect the data.*
*How many data-points do you (realistically) hope to collect?*
*Do you foresee any difficulty in the data collection process?*
*Approximatively, how "heavy" do you think your dataset will be in the end?*

----------

Model \& Methods
----------
*To the best of your current knowledge, what type of statistical/data analysis tools do you feel will be relevant?*
*Explain briefly why.*

*If there's some cutting edge methods you may like to implement, cite it here adding the relevant paper(s)/book(s) in the last Section of this document.*

----------


Software/Hardware Toolkit
----------
*Tell me something about the software, programming language(s), package(s), module(s), framework(s) you're planning to use and why.*
*Are you also planning to use or develop [dedicated hardware](https://sciencejournal.withgoogle.com/developers/) for this task?*
*If you feel your home-computer/laptop may not be enough to handle everything, explain to me why and what kind of resources you may instead need.*

----------

Project Timeline
----------
*Assuming I like and approve your proposal, detail how you are planning to organize your work in terms of sub-tasks completion.
If you know what a [Gantt diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) is, [use it](https://plot.ly/r/gantt/)!*
